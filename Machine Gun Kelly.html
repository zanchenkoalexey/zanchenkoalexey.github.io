            <p>Ричард Колсон Бэйкер (Richard Сolson Baker) родился 22 апреля 1990 года в Хьюстоне, Техас. Родители мальчика много путешествовали, поэтому ему довелось пожить в Германии, Египте, Чикаго, Девнер и Кливленде. Будучи активным подростком, Ричард стал интересоваться суб-культурами. С 6-ти лет он начал слушать рэп. Свой псевдоним музыкант взял в честь известного гангстера Джорджа «Пулемет» Келли.</p>
            <p>В 2011 году Ричард подписал контракт с Джемми Айовином и Дидди. Его первый сингл «Wild Boy» вышел 27 сентября 2011 года. Песня заняла 98 строчку в чарте US Billboard Hot 100. Вторая песня рэпера ««Invincible» была использована в рекламе для HTC ReZound. Свою известность получил после выхода четырех микстейпов: «Stamp Of Approval», «Homecoming», «100 Words and Running», «Lace Up». В 2012 году стал лицом обложки журнала «XXL». В 2016 году музыкант попробовал себя в роли актера в фильме «Вирус».</p>
            <p>У артиста имеется дочь Кейси (род. в 2008 году). MGK открыто говорил о своей двухлетней героиновой зависимости, упоминая об этом в своей песне «Lead You On». Также об этом упоминается в песнях «Alice in Wonderland» и «Eddie Cane». Во многих интервью упоминал, что ежедневно курит марихуанну, описывая это «как источник счастья и способ, благодаря которому люди могут почувствовать немного больше любви». Касаемо его философии, MGK позиционирует себя,как анархист.</p>

Текст песни

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream 'bout
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever like
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me of novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever like
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever like
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Текст песни

No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly
This kid, I think he is a star
He's one of the best live performers I've ever seen
He's also more importantly a movement

Backpack? Fuck that
I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my shit,
get an iPhone take a video and make it last long get some popcorn
 because I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a muthafucka isn't gonna stop the shit
Until I make an album like a 2pacalypse
Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments
Until I'm always hot no matter what the climate is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative my name is brought up,
 doesn't matter what the topic is
Didn't think I rap? Bitch I flow like "boom boom bap"
Bitch I come from where you never moved at
Look into my room get a view, look at my past
God damn
Got weed, got jack, oxy's? Had that
Got Jimi, got Slash, got shrooms, got hash
Bipolar syndrome, kicked in, got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my ass you bitch

(More Sound Clips of Various People talking about MGK)
He was truly the only developed on-point performer on the bill
If you know anything about lyricists, then you know who MGK is
I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit

Fuck that, y'all don't gotta hear shit
Ask anybody in the 216 if my name rings bells in them bricks
"Man everybody know who that is"
What you hate, boy? You late, boy
You ain't heard about that great boy?
3 letter name cacausian boy
Used to live right there up the way, boy
You heard about him, you've said the name
You saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and you bought the shit
Put him on the playlist right next to Jay
Then your girl saw me, I signed her tits
And she disappeared you couldn't find the bitch
Then your heart stopped you know what time it is
I put my dick in her common sense
Fuck boy you lonely
Fuck boy you phony
You would think these fuck boys fucking boys with the way that they be all on me
If it ain't EST in your mouth...then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it? That shit's boring, bitch I'm snoring
Man I'm touring every damn day
I showed y'all how to turn up
100 j's in my ashtray bitch I showed y'all how to burn up
I sacrificed what y'all wouldn't give to these kids and now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell 'em quit jocking my ass
God damn...
And y'all can have the bloggers I don't type shit
God gave me both these hands to fight with
Wassup!?
Now say goodnight quick because my right fist's like Vicodin
Might just throw you on the ground like dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license,
 get a wallet and a couple dollars, buy nice shit
Dyke bitches all over my dick, that's priceless
I just fuck 'em if they're wet like Pisces
Wives is jealous of the bitch I'm with cause they almost F'd like D-...get it?
Digest every little word I'm spittin' cause it's food for thought so pay attention
Better listen, I’m on a mission to killing off all of my competition and
 if you are with that then good riddance muthafucka!

Now Machine Gun Kelly seems like somebody you would diss,
 lyrically I wouldn't think you'd like Machine Gun Kelly
What are you trying to say, he's wack or something?
He is wack
He's not wack
He's better than 80% of the rappers out there
It must be nice being MGK right now
The rapper recently released what he says to be the true
 meaning of his Lace Up movement
If there was ever a musical speaker that I could put out there
 for my personality, Machine Gun Kelly was it

Текст песни

Uh, this ain't no halo over my head, bitch
But dear God, can you forgive the sinning
For everything I done did since my beginning
Because the devil around me so much
 that you would think I got a death wish?
Yeah, and the voices in my head get louder
Watching my career disappear like powder (Poof)
Wish I could rewind those hours and get my life back (Back)
Strike that, clinging to this weed like a life jacket (Yeah)
Fuck rapping, I was really living everything
that I was spitting, bitch
What's happening? (Wassup)
Fights daily, nights crazy,
dream chasing till the drugs came in
I was chopping up them bitches like Jason
Had a muthafucker's face laying
on the cold pavement (Uh)
Wake up, take 'em, now I feel sane (Whoop)
Spending every penny in the studio slaving (Yeah)
Me and my mob working any odd job
Praying that this little dream was gonna feed our babies
Save me Lord, save me Lord,
what the fuck is this curse you gave me Lord?
Everybody think I finally made it Lord,
but all I am now is a slave, my God

And Revelation says
"He will wipe every tear from their
 eyes and death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For the former things have passed away"
EST for life, muthafucker!

Ughk, put that halo around my neck, bitch (Bitch)
And gimmie death
I'm twenty-two and this twenty-two on my left, God bless
Maybe I'll finally sleep
Maybe they'll return what's originally mine,
 cause finder's keep
Maybe I will be great,
and this voice of mine was designed to be the finest key
But, I'm losing faith (Ok)
Everyday they got news to break
Like my single flopped, and now I ain't hot
And they don't know if Imma ever gonna see the light of day
It's "My labels mad" or "My albums bad" or
 "You ain't living up to the hype we thought you had"
Or I lost a fan, or I'm in cuffs again
Yeah, meanwhile I ain't there to be my daughter's dad
Fuck what's meant for me,
 because I don't ever wanna become a celebrity
I don't ever want someone to feel less than me
So put your camera down and
stand next to me (Right here!)
EST, Everyone Stand Together
And if I, ever R-I-P,
then I know everything I stand for's forever
Lace Up!

And when you play this song
Hold your head high, muthafucker
Don't ever look down because of who you are
Our flaws are what makes us perfect
